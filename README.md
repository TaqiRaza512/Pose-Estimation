## 🚀 Project Summary

* We analyze basketball player movement data, potentially from video or image sequences.
* Utilize MediaPipe for pose estimation to extract keypoint coordinates.
* Combine pose data with existing player statistics for more comprehensive analysis.
* Potentially perform clustering or prediction based on movement characteristics.

## 🛠️ Key Steps

1.  **Data Loading & Exploration:**
    * Load basketball player datasets.
    * Inspect video or image data (if applicable).
    * Explore relationships between player statistics.
2.  **Pose Estimation with MediaPipe:**
    * Process video or images using MediaPipe to extract pose landmarks.
    * Calculate relevant movement features (e.g., joint angles, velocities).
3.  **Data Integration & Feature Engineering:**
    * Combine pose features with player statistics.
    * Create new features to represent movement patterns.
4.  **Analysis & Modeling:**
    * Perform clustering to group players based on movement.
    * Potentially build models to predict performance based on movement.
    * Visualize movement characteristics.

## 📊 Key Results (Potential)

* Identification of distinct movement patterns among players.
* Correlation between movement features and player performance.
* Visualization of movement characteristics.
* Prediction of performance based on movement data.

## 💻 Tech Used

* Python, Pandas, NumPy
* OpenCV (cv2), MediaPipe
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (potentially)
